Understand Asymptotic Notation

    Big O Notation:
       Big O Notation is a mathematical notation used to describe the upper bound of an algorithm's running time. 
       It provides a high-level understanding of the algorithm's efficiency and performance in terms of input size. 
       The notation focuses on the worst-case scenario, making it useful for comparing the efficiency of different 
       algorithms.

    Best, Average, and Worst-Case Scenarios
      Best Case: The scenario where the algorithm performs the minimum number of operations. For a search operation, 
                 this might be finding the desired element immediately.
      Average Case: The scenario that considers the average number of operations over all possible inputs. 
                    This provides a more realistic expectation of performance.
      Worst Case: The scenario where the algorithm performs the maximum number of operations. For a search operation, 
                  this could be when the desired element is the last one to be checked or not present at all.

Analysis

    Time Complexity->

        Linear Search:
            Best Case: 𝑂(1)- The element is found at the first position.
            Average Case: 𝑂(𝑛) - The element is somewhere in the middle.
            	    Worst Case: 𝑂(𝑛) - The element is at the last position or not present at all.

       	 Binary Search:
           	     Best Case: 𝑂(1) - The element is found at the mid position on the first check.
                   Average Case: 𝑂(log⁡ 𝑛) - The element is somewhere in the sorted array.
            Worst Case: 𝑂(log 𝑛) - The element is not present, requiring maximum divisions of the search interval.

        Suitability of the Platform

        Binary Search is More efficient for larger datasets due to its logarithmic time complexity. Requires the data 
        to be sorted, which adds an initial sorting overhead but pays off in search performance for large datasets. 
	For an e-commerce platform with potentially large datasets, binary search is generally more suitable due to
	its significantly better performance with large arrays. 
        The initial sorting of the array can be managed, and the fast search performance will enhance the user 
	experience.
