Explain different sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort).
Bubble Sort: Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based algorithm. It repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the list is sorted.
Time Complexity:
Best case: 𝑂(𝑛)
Average case: 𝑂(𝑛^2)
Worst case: 𝑂(𝑛^2)
Space Complexity: 𝑂(1)

Insertion Sort: Insertion Sort builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It takes each element from the input and finds the appropriate location within the sorted part of the list and inserts it there.
Time Complexity:
Best case: 𝑂(𝑛)
Average case: 𝑂(𝑛^2)
Worst case: 𝑂(𝑛^2)
Space Complexity: 𝑂(1)

Quick Sort: Quick Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It selects a 'pivot' element and partitions the array into two sub-arrays: elements less than the pivot and elements greater than the pivot. It then recursively sorts the sub-arrays.
Time Complexity:
Best case: 𝑂(𝑛log𝑛)
Average case: 𝑂(𝑛log⁡𝑛)
Worst case: 𝑂(𝑛^2)
Space Complexity: 𝑂(log𝑛)  

Merge Sort: Merge Sort is another divide-and-conquer algorithm. It divides the array into two halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the two sorted halves.
Time Complexity:
Best case: 𝑂(𝑛log⁡𝑛)
Average case: 𝑂(𝑛log𝑛)
Worst case: 𝑂(𝑛log𝑛)
Space Complexity: 𝑂(𝑛)

Analysis
Compare the performance (time complexity) of Bubble Sort and Quick Sort
Bubble Sort: Time complexity is 𝑂(𝑛^2) in the average and worst case, making it inefficient for large datasets.
Space complexity is 𝑂(1) since it sorts the array in place.
Quick Sort: Time complexity is 𝑂(𝑛log𝑛) on average, making it more efficient for large datasets. Worst-case time
complexity is 𝑂(𝑛^2), but this can be mitigated with good pivot selection strategies
(e.g., random pivot, median-of-three).
Space complexity is 𝑂(log𝑛) due to the recursive nature of the algorithm.

Why Quick Sort is Generally Preferred
Efficiency: Quick Sort is generally faster for large datasets due to its average time complexity of 𝑂(𝑛log𝑛). The divide-and-conquer strategy is more efficient than the simple comparison-based approach of
Bubble Sort.
Adaptability: Quick Sort can be optimized with different pivot selection strategies to avoid the worst-case scenario, making it more adaptable to different kinds of data.
Space Usage: While both Bubble Sort and Quick Sort are in-place sorting algorithms, Quick Sort's recursive nature uses additional space, but this is often negligible compared to the gains in time complexity.

In summary, Quick Sort is preferred over Bubble Sort for sorting large datasets due to its superior average-case time complexity and adaptability, despite its worst-case scenario being similar to that of Bubble Sort.
